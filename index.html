      <p>I'm Peg Mickelson... Mom to 2 cool kids; technology professional; student at UMN Coding Bootcamp. I own a 1908 house in St. Paul near the bluff over Harriet Island. I build LEGOs with my son and play sports with my daughter. We have a rescue pup named Elsie Bacon.</p>

      <p>Son of a gun. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.

        That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.</p>
